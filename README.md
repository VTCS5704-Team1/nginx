# nginx
* nginx container for Frontend
* Runs on Port 3000

## Notes to Grader:
* This is just a separate repo for configuring the container used to host the UI for AWS.
* The UI container uses the NGINX container when deploying

## Notes for Deployment:
* These NGINX settings should be updated to have more robust security.
